    % Abstract
\section*{Abstract} 
        \hspace{1cm} Even in cases where a project is delayed or concludes earlier than anticipated, the accomplishments are still valuable. Even if the results fall short of our expectations, the important thing is to salvage as much as we can from the work completed. Keeping track of everything that transpired aids in our understanding of why things didn't work out and may come in handy should we decide to take the project again in the future. It's important to acknowledge everyone's efforts and have candid conversations about what may have been done better. Even though the project is coming to an end, closing on a good note prepares the ground for even better future cooperation.

        An essential component of this closure is communication. In order to reduce any negative emotions stemming from the project's early termination, open and inclusive discussions help to create a climate of trust and understanding. Furthermore, by accepting this outcome as a group learning opportunity, the team is able to change and becomes a force for future successful collaborations.
        
        A project that is terminated is, in essence, a turning point rather than just the conclusion. It serves as a forum for discussing mistakes, recognizing accomplishments, and laying the groundwork for future triumphs. It's about saying goodbye in a cordial manner with the knowledge that the lessons learned will support future initiatives. It's a chance to move past the "what could have been" and toward the "what can be," turning obstacles into stepping stones toward more promising goals.

    \end{enumerate}
    % Methods & Methodology
    \section{Methods \& Methodology}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{PRINCE2: }Is a structured project management methodology that places a strong emphasis on ongoing business justification, distinct roles and responsibilities, and efficient communication. PRINCE2 offers guidelines on formal project closure processes in the event that a project is terminated prematurely.[1]

        \item \textbf{Agile Retrospectives:} Continue holding retrospectives even when a project is canceled. Teams are encouraged to consider what worked, what didn't, and what may be improved by using this process. Even in closure, it permits ongoing learning and modification.[2]

        \item \textbf{Lean Six Sigma:} Apply Lean Six Sigma techniques to carry out an exhaustive performance study of the project. Determine inefficiencies and wasteful practices as well as areas that could be improved. Even in projects that are canceled, this method can provide valuable information.[3]

        \item \textbf{Scrum's Sprint Review and Retrospective:} Even if a project is ending early, its progress, successes, and areas for improvement can be evaluated through adaptation of the sprint review and retrospective rituals in Agile organizations that use Scrum.[4]
        
        \item \textbf{Kanban's Flow Review:} The primary goal of Kanban approaches is to visualize work and process. Review the flow to see where bottlenecks occurred, what was accomplished, and what work was still pending. This can help in figuring out the project's status at the time of cancellation.[5]

        \item \textbf{Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM):} Determine the project's critical path by applying CCPM methods. Examine the limitations and postponements that caused the project to be canceled, and plan how to handle them better in the future.[6]

        \item \textbf{Stage-Gate Methodology:} This strategy divides the project into discrete phases and places gates—decision points—between each phase. Evaluate the project's condition at each gate and decide whether to move forward, make changes, or end it. If cancelation is required, this approach can offer precise points for decision-making.[7]

        \item \textbf{Adaptive Project Framework (APF):} It emphasizes flexibility and adaptation in project management. APF offers advice on how to move forward, change course, or end a project politely and promotes a systematic assessment of the project's current status.[8]

    \end{enumerate}
    
    % Results Obtained
    \section{Results}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Sustaining Team Morale:} Even in the event that the project is canceled, team morale can be maintained through open communication and recognition of contributions. Team members may not become demotivated or disillusioned as a result of this.
        \item \textit{Preserving relationships:} You may protect ties that could be useful in upcoming projects or collaborations by keeping good interactions with vendors, team members, and stakeholders.
        \item \textit{Knowledge Retention:} By recording lessons learned, you may make sure that important takeaways from the shelved project are preserved for later use. This information can help avoid such errors and guide decision-making in the future.
        \item \textit{Smooth transition:} Helping impacted team members migrate to new projects or roles reduces interruption and guarantees a more seamless change in responsibility.
        \item \textit{Better Decision-Making:} Assessing the cancellation procedure facilitates the identification of red flags and project failure-related variables. This knowledge may help avoid similar problems in the future by enhancing decision-making for subsequent projects.
        \item \textit{Use of Insights:} By carefully using the recorded lessons learned and experiences obtained, future efforts can make the best use of available resources and information.
        \item \textit{Professional Reputation:} Managing the cancellation process with care and professionalism presents a positive image of the business and shows that it is resilient, flexible, and dedicated to learning from its mistakes.

    \end{itemize}
    
    % Conclusions and Future Works
    \section{Conclusions and Future Works}
    \hspace{1cm} \textbf{Suggested Improvements:} Improving the methodical documenting procedure could expedite analysis in the future and allow for the learning of abandoned projects. Developing more organized frameworks for the evaluation of salvageable assets could hasten the process of locating and utilizing useful components. Furthermore, encouraging ongoing stakeholder participation after the project ends may provide more in-depth understanding of the mitigating factors that contribute to project termination. 
    
        \hspace{1cm} In a nutshell early project termination offers a wealth of priceless learning opportunities even though it can appear to be the end of the project. Preserving reusable elements, thorough documentation, recognizing individual efforts, and cultivating goodwill after project completion are crucial actions. Accepting these methods facilitates closure and serves as a launchpad for better projects and teamwork in the future.
